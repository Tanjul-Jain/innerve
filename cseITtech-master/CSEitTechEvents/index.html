<!--On the magical lands of Hogwarts, the triwizard tournament is being held once again. The Triwizard Tournament was first established some seven hundred years ago as a friendly competition between the three largest European schools of wizardry: <b>Hogwarts, Beauxbatons, and Durmstrang</b>. A champion was selected to represent each school, and the three champions competed in three magical tasks. The schools took it in turns to host the tournament once every five years, and it was generally agreed to be a most excellent way of establishing ties between young witches and wizards of different nationalities.So this year you get a chance to participate in this prestigious tournament, but be ready to answer a few quirky questions!! <br>Before the main tournament there is preliminary round to storm your brain which will be followed by the 3 main stages. All the 4 levels including the preliminary one will have a Harry Potter related question followed by a coding question. You'll have to choose a harry Potter question answering which correctly (under 1 minute) will earn you a hint for your coding question.<br><br>üî∏ The first stage will be to get past a fierce dragon and choose between one of it's eggs which will lead you to question around spells and charms. <br><br>üî∏ The second stage revolves around choosing a character's frame which will have a question pertaining to their skillset or character. <br><br>üî∏The third and final stage will be a difficult one. Choose your path wisely to get to the centre of the maze which has the triwizard cup. As you tread upon the chosen path you'll encounter a riddle. <br><br><b>Beware of cheating as Dumbledore's watching you!!</b><br><br>-->

        Team Size : Single Player. <br><br>Our world is facing the threat of this virus. The pandemic has affected most of the human population. Looking into this, the government decided to send a team of immensely talented doctors across the world to the most affected parts of the world. And you are one of them. You will be assigned a country where almost 50% of the population is already infected. You are supposed to utilize your skills to solve the questions given, in order to unlock the vaccine injections to cure them. Your target is to cut the percentage of infected people as much possible and save that country from this pandemic. But this virus is highly contagious and spreads from one person to another through various modes. Hence you will have to solve the given question in the given time otherwise the diseases will keep on spreading infecting more people. Your country might even turn into a red alert zone, but don‚Äôt worry, you will be given an option to call our special forces for your help. As your region turns red an ambulance will reach to you with a bonus question that will help you cut off your infected population and remove the red alert. After you successfully solve all the stages of questions, your region will finally become uninfected and will turn green. Each player is expected to try their best to get people out of this pandemic. Saviours, get ready to save the world!

         A vast and treacherous ocean. One mystical treasure. And you are not the only one seeking the riches of the treasure of Avery Henry. Join this game loaded with strategy and coding, to battle with 9 more savage pirates seeking the treasure at the end. Attack enemy ships with cannonballs of coding questions and if you are struck yourself, solve the question to gain treasure coins. If you fail to answer the question correctly or if the timer runs out, you lose health points. Should you lose all your health points, your voyage in this game shall end. An inactivity of more than 30 seconds will reduce your health points and a ship can‚Äôt be attacked more than once at the same time, so keep up the battle but don‚Äôt gang up on anyone ;-) You will start with 100XP health points and 0 treasure coins.The treasure shall go to the last one standing but if more than one ship manages to last till the end, the one with highest number of treasure coins gets the treasure and wins the game! Wishing you a fair wind ever and always!
